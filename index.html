      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p class="intro">
      I am a recent graduate at Brock University for the Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies.
      My experience to date shows my strong work ethic, my ability to develop exceptional communication and time management skills. Furthermore, I am a good team player exemplified by a lifetime of working and playing within sport, specifically basketball. I am a responsible, presentable and personable individual with a mature attitude. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="intro1">My experiences as a Residence Don combined with my sports and acting background, have allowed me to fulfill all responsibilities and engage with prospective students. Studying courses within my program, I have learned the value of collaboration and have been able to improve my skills as a leader. Throughout my academic life, I have always strived to be a good ambassador and role model to other students. This is demonstrated by my previous experience as a student prefect and Badger Brigadier at Brock University. Both positions required excellent communication, patience and understanding.
      </p>
